# Stream Overlay and Dashboard

This is my personal attempt at making a stream overlay to use in OBS Studio. Paired with a dashboard for quick actions and configuratiing.

### Goals

- [ ] Simple widgets that are configurable from dashboard.
  - [ ] To Do Widget (List of things to accomplish during the stream)
  - [ ] Twitch Chat
  - [ ] Poll/Vote
  - [ ] Lower Thirds
- [ ] Switch OBS Studio Scenes
  - [ ] Toggle Sources within scene
- [ ] Configure Twitch
  - [ ] Stream Title.
  - [ ] Going Live Notification message.
  - [ ] Switch Chat to Follower-only/subscriber-only/emote-only.
